    "## Recurrent Neural Networks for Language Modeling \n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is a powerful family of neural networks that are widely used for sequence modeling tasks (e.g. stock price prediction, language modeling). RNNs ability to exploit temporal dependecies of entities in a sequence makes them powerful. In this exercise we will model a RNN and learn tips and tricks to improve the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will do the following.\n",
    "1. Create word vectors for a dataset created from stories available [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~spok/grimmtmp/)\n",
    "2. Train a RNN model on the dataset and use it to output a new story"
